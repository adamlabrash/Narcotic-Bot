darknet-analysis
==============================

A data extraction pipeline and dataset that monitors narcotic prices on darknet marketplaces. Ultimately this project aims to track the prices and traffic of narcotics over a sustained period of time.

For now, the project only monitors the White House Market, which is one of the more popular illicit marketplaces.

Data:
Data is in CSV and .SQL format, and will be updated each month. 

The data is only as accurate as the listing itself. If a vendor is lying about their product, and will negatively change the data


*** While this project is completely legal, but I do not hold responsibility for how others may use this software. ***

Future implementations:
    -nlp and advanced analysis
    -Extract from more marketplaces
    -web-hosted dashboard
